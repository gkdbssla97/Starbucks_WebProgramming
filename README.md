Front-End / Back-End PGM

I want to be a back-end developer, but I am developing a web in order to study front-end at the same time.
After the web production is completed, my own web development is planned at a later date.

#day1

Changed the mobile-only interface when resizing the window screen by dragging from the full screen
It can be seen that the text format is changed to the icon format.

#day3
-Web

-Mobile

The bottom of the screen is set to be web or mobile depending on the window size. In setting the image composition and layout of the background, there was a difficulty in that the layout is broken if the size is reduced.

#day4
-Web

Following day3, a button was created at the bottom of the web. There was a problem that the frame was broken because there was a conflict between inline and block setting and padding.
