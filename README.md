Front-End / Back-End PGM

I want to be a back-end developer, but I am developing a web in order to study front-end at the same time.
After the web production is completed, my own web development is planned at a later date.

#day1

Changed the mobile-only interface when resizing the window screen by dragging from the full screen
It can be seen that the text format is changed to the icon format.

#day3
-Web

The bottom of the screen is set to be web or mobile depending on the window size. In setting the image composition and layout of the background, there was a difficulty in that the layout is broken if the size is reduced.

#day4
-Web

Following day3, a button was created at the bottom of the web. There was a problem that the frame was broken because there was a conflict between inline and block setting and padding.

#day5
-Web

Finally, I made a simple screen configuration. Since it is a responsive web production, it was difficult to work with not only the web but also tablets and mobiles in mind.
Buttons for membership registration and login are also planned to be linked.
As the back-end is the goal, I will continue to create web sites.
